# zenml-ml-forecast
A forecast use case to demonstrate Zenml capabilities


The example and the code comes from this [repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/retail-forecast)
I hasn't change the code of this example. Purpose of this repository is to showcase Zenml capabilities not providing high standard python code.
